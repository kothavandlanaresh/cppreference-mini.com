## Overview
Demonstrates the use of `constexpr` in C++ to define a constant expression integer.

## Key Points

- üìù **Constant Expression Integer (`constexpr`)**: Defines a variable whose value is known at compile-time.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    constexpr int x = 5;
    ```

- üìù **Regular Integer**: Defines a regular integer whose value can be modified at runtime.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    int y = 5;
    ```

- üìù **Attempt to Modify `constexpr`**: Shows that modifying a `constexpr` variable results in a compilation error.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    // x = 6; // Error: assignment of read-only variable 'x'
    ```

- üìù **Modify Regular Integer**: Shows that modifying a regular integer is allowed.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    y = 6; // No error
    ```

- üìù **Printing Values**: Prints the values of the `constexpr` and regular integer to the standard output.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl;
    std::cout << "y: " << y << std::endl;
    ```

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
