## Overview
Demonstrates the behavior of modifying a constant integer through a pointer cast in C++.

## Key Points

- üìù **Constant Integer**: Declares a constant integer `x` with a value of 5.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    const int x = 5;
    ```

- üìù **Pointer Casting**: Creates a pointer `p` that points to `x` by casting away the constness.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    int *p = (int*)&x;
    ```

- üìù **Modifying Constant**: Modifies the value pointed to by `p` to 6.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    *p = 6;
    ```

- üìù **Printing the Value**: Prints the value of `x` to the standard output.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    std::cout << x << std::endl;
    ```

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
