## Overview
Demonstrates the difference between compile-time and runtime calculations in C++ using factorial examples.

## Key Points

- üìù **Compile-time Calculation**: Uses `constexpr` to evaluate the factorial function at compile-time.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    constexpr int factorial(int n) {
        return (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1));
    }
    ```

- üìù **Runtime Calculation**: Uses a loop to evaluate the factorial function at runtime.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    int factorial_runtime(int n) {
        int result = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            result *= i;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
