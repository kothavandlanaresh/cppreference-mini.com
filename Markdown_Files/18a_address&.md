## Overview
Demonstrates the use of `(void *)` cast to print addresses of variables and handling void pointers in functions.

## Key Points

- üìù **Void Pointers**: A pointer that can hold the address of any data type.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    void* ptr;
    int a = 10;
    ptr = &a; // ptr now holds the address of an integer
    ```

- üìù **Casting to Void Pointer**: Used to print the address of a variable.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    std::cout << "Address of a: " << (void *)&a << std::endl;
    ```

- üìù **Handling Void Pointers in Functions**: Demonstrates how to cast void pointers back to the appropriate type.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    void printValue(void* ptr, int type) {
        if (type == 0) { // int
            std::cout << "Integer value: " << *(static_cast<int*>(ptr)) << std::endl;
        } else if (type == 1) { // double
            std::cout << "Double value: " << *(static_cast<double*>(ptr)) << std::endl;
        } else if (type == 2) { // char
            std::cout << "Char value: " << *(static_cast<char*>(ptr)) << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Unknown type" << std::endl;
        }
    }
    ```

 * @brief Demonstrates the use of (void *) cast to print addresses of variables and handling void pointers in functions.
 *
 * This program declares three variables of different types: int, double, and char.
 * It then prints the memory addresses of these variables using the (void *) cast.
 * The (void *) cast is used to convert the address of a variable to a void pointer,
 * which can then be printed using std::cout.
 *
 * Additionally, the program includes a function [`printValue`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fk6ros%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2FCPP%2FCPP_Notes%2F18a_address%26.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%22b89e7156-a3c9-4d49-9170-1e713c6d1e95%22%5D "Go to definition") that takes a void pointer
 * and an integer indicating the type of data the pointer points to. The function
 * demonstrates how to cast the void pointer back to the appropriate type and print the value.
 *
 * @details
 * - int a: An integer variable initialized to 10.
 * - double b: A double variable initialized to 20.5.
 * - char c: A character variable initialized to 'A'.
 *
 * The addresses of these variables are printed in the following format:
 * - Address of a: <address>
 * - Address of b: <address>
 * - Address of c: <address>
 *
 * The values of these variables are printed using the [`printValue`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fk6ros%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2FCPP%2FCPP_Notes%2F18a_address%26.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%22b89e7156-a3c9-4d49-9170-1e713c6d1e95%22%5D "Go to definition") function.
 *
 * @note The (void *) cast is necessary because std::cout does not have an overload
 * for printing addresses of non-void pointers directly (e.g., &a, &b, &c). By casting the address to a void pointer, it can be printed using std::cout.
 * The reason why non-void pointers are not allowed is because the compiler does not know the type of the pointer and it will not know how to print it.
 * Although a, b, c are of different types, the address of a, b, c are of the same type, so we can cast them to void pointer.
 * The (void *) cast is used to convert the address of a variable to a void pointer, which can then be printed using std::cout.
 * @note The memory addresses of variables can change each time the program is run, as they are assigned by the operating system.
